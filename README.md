There remains several sets of changes and improvments. There are also numerous absolete pieces  to be removed. Eventually, all code samples should be made visible in our documents.

Pls review navigation bar on home page. There are two links to determine the state-of-play for this website.

See the HACKING menu dropdown. The Readme pages is being worked on to provide an outline of the project structure, gradle scripts, folder placement, etc.

The Todo page has a list of started, not started, proposed topics to include in our documentation.
