:description: GPars is a multi-paradigm concurrency framework offering several mutually cooperating high-level concurrency abstractions.

== Deadlock: An Introduction

*Deadlock* occurs whenever a network of processes gets into a state where none of the processes is able to continue execution.
 
A similar and related problem is that of *livelock*, which occurs when part of a process network operates in such a manner as to exclude some of the processes from execution, while others are able to continue. 
A first simple example, based upon the producer â€“ consumer pattern, already discussed, demonstrates the ease with which a deadlocked system can be created.

=== Deadlocking Producer and Consumer

'Listing 7-1' gives the coding for a process *BadP*. The process has two channels (2, 3). Its run-method initially prints a starting message (5) after which it enters a loop (6). 
A message indicating the process is about to write to outChannel (7) is printed and then the output takes place (8). The same action is then undertaken for a read method on inChannel (9, 10). 
A message indicating that the end of the loop has been reached is printed (11) and the process loops back to (6).
