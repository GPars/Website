== Code Style

A few simple rules to follow when contributing to the *GPars* project:

 . Prefer _final_ wherever applicable - variables, parameters, methods and classes
 . Single-statement conditions, _else_ branches or loops don't need braces - _if (cond) latch.countDown()_
 . Place the openning brace on the same line - _class Foo {_
 . Follow the common Java/Groovy naming and capitalization conventions
 . _Tab_ size is four characters
 . The _Code Style_ IntelliJ IDEA inspection profile is the ultimate guide and verification mechanism for the *GPars* code base. The regular reports can be checked (after login) at http://teamcity.jetbrains.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=bt183&tab=buildTypeStatusDiv[the particular TeamCity page].
 . Any apidoc for methods with Closure arguments like in _Promise.java_ should declare which arguments are passed into the closure call and which return values (if any) are expected.
