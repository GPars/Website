==  User Guide To *GAE*

=== Google App Engine Integration

*GPars* can be run on the https://developers.google.com/appengine/[Google App Engine (*GAE*)].  It can be made
part of *Groovy* and *Java* _GAE applications_ as well as a plugged into *Gaelyk*.

NOTE: The https://developers.google.com/appengine/[Google App Engine] is known as *GAE*

The small https://github.com/musketyr/gpars-appengine[GPars App Engine integration library] provides all the necessary infrastructure to hook *GAE* services into *GPars*.  
Although you'll be running on *GAE* threads and leveraging *GAE* timer services, the high-level abstractions remain the same.  
With a few restrictions you can still use *GPars* _actors, dataflow, agents, parallel collections_ and other handy concepts.

Please refer to the https://github.com/musketyr/gpars-appengine[GPars App Engine library] for details on how to proceed with *GPars* on *GAE*.
