= Google App Engine Integration

GPars can be run on the https://developers.google.com/appengine/[Google App Engine (GAE)].  It can be made
part of Groovy and Java GAE applications as well as a plugged into Gaelyk.  The small
https://github.com/musketyr/gpars-appengine[GPars App Engine integration library] provides all the necessary
infrastructure to hook GAE services into GPars.  Although you'll be running on GAE threads and leveraging
GAE timer services, the high-level abstractions remain the same.  With a few restrictions you can still use
GPars actors, dataflow, agents, parallel collections and other handy concepts.

Please refer to the https://github.com/musketyr/gpars-appengine[GPars App Engine library] documentation for
details on how to proceed with GPars on GAE.
