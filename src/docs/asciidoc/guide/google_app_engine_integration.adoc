:description: GPars is a multi-paradigm concurrency framework offering several mutually cooperating high-level concurrency abstractions.
:doctitle: User Guide To Google App Engine Integration

*GPars* can be run on the https://developers.google.com/appengine/[Google App Engine (*GAE*)].  It can be made
part of *Groovy* and *Java* _GAE applications_ as well as a plugged into *Gaelyk*.

NOTE: The https://developers.google.com/appengine/[Google App Engine] is known as *GAE*

''''

The small https://github.com/musketyr/gpars-appengine[GPars App Engine integration library] provides all the necessary
infrastructure to hook *GAE* services into *GPars*.  Although you'll be running on *GAE* threads and leveraging
*GAE* timer services, the high-level abstractions remain the same.  With a few restrictions you can still use
*GPars* _actors, dataflow, agents, parallel collections_ and other handy concepts.

Please refer to the https://github.com/musketyr/gpars-appengine[GPars App Engine library] for details on how to proceed with *GPars* on *GAE*.
