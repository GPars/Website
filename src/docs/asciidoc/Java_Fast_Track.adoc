:description: GPars is a multi-paradigm concurrency framework offering several mutually cooperating high-level concurrency abstractions.
:doctitle: Java Fast Track


Most of the concurrent functionality *GPars* provides to Groovy code is also
available from Java. Actors, reactors, agents or dataflow concurrency - these
can all be used directly from Java.

To give Java developers a head start, we prepared a http://gpars.org/download/1.1.0/gpars-mvn-java-demo-1.1.0.zip[sample pure Java project] that you can grab, extract and experiment with. The maven pom file will show you
how to setup necessary dependencies and the included Java classes will give you an immediate insight into the *GPars* Java API.

Get the http://gpars.org/download/1.1.0/gpars-mvn-java-demo-1.1.0.zip[Sample Pure Java Project].

You may also check out the http://www.gpars.org/guide/guide/gettingStarted.html#gettingStarted_JavaAPI-usingGParsFromJava[Java APIsection] in the link:./guide[User Guide] as well as the many code examples of *GPars* use.
