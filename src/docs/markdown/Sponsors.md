# Sponsors

## JetBrains

We're using [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html) by
[Jetbrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/) to write, refactor, analyze and
maintain code.

For Continuous Integration, which builds our software day-and-night, tests it
and monitors its quality, we use
[TeamCity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/index.html) hosted at the [public
TeamCity hosting](http://teamcity.jetbrains.com) site.

## Codehaus

[Codehaus](http://www.codehaus.org/) gave us home and provided the development
ecosystem, including a git repository, a wiki, mailinglists, etc.

## Atlassian

[Atlassian](http://www.altassian.com/) is provided
JIRA/Confluence/Clover/Bamboo, which we also happily use.

## Sponsorship and donations

We will accept donations or sponsorship. Please contact us at
_consult@gpars.org_ with your offers.
