/**
 * A demo showing two cooperating actors. The decryptor decrypts received messages and replies them back.
 * The console actor sends a message to decrypt, prints out the reply and terminates both actors.
 * The main thread waits on both actors to finish using the join() method to prevent premature exit,
 * since both actors use the default pooled actor group,  which uses a daemon thread pool.
