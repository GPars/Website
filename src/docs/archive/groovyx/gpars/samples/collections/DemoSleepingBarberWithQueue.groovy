/*
Demo for solving the classic sleeping barber problem with the help
of core Java features (blocking queue) in combination with gpars' actors that
care for putting queue operations and business operations into
proper uninterrupted sequence.
The println of sleeping, taking seats, leaving, and starting/stopping the shave
are placeholders for business operations.
