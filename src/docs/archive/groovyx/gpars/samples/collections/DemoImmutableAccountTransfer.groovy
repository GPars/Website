/**
 * Demos one possible use of Groovy immutable support for the classical
 * account money transfer problem.
 * Account becomes immutable without knowing anything about synchronization.
 * However, since transferTo() returns two new Accounts, these references
 * must be assigned in one atomic action. This is what AtomicPair cares for.
 * Locks are restricted to the reference updates only, while potentially
 * long-running business tasks (longer than transferTo) can run lock-free.
 * Note that in this example there is no consistent global "world view".
 * All transfers happen, they all get rebalanced, no concurrent transfer
 * is ever influenced by a temporarily inconsistent state of other
 * transfers. However, since there is no atomic get-and-set operation on the AtomicPair,
 * this example does not support the notion of updating an account
 * based on the balance that a concurrent transfer has effected.
