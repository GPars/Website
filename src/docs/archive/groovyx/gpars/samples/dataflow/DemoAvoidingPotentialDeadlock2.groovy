/**
 * Demonstrates deadlock prevention using the whenBound (>>) dataflow construct. Instead of blocking the task
 * together with its underlying thread on a read call to DataflowVariable.val, the whenBound handler will be invoked only
 * after the value of the DataflowVariable is set and so the reader doesn't consume a thread while waiting for a value
 * to arrive.
 * The code would end up deadlocked if we blocked the threads during reads, since the first two tasks
 * wait for each other to bind values to a and b. Only the third thread can unlock the two threads by setting value of a.
