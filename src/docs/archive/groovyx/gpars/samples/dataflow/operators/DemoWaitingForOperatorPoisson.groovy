/**
 * Dataflow operators and selectors can be stopped in two ways - calling the terminate() method on all operators that need to be stopped
 * or by sending a poisson message. This demo shows the second approach.
 * By using a CountingPoisonPill other threads can be waiting for a specified number of operators in the network to be terminated.
 *
 * After receiving a poisson an operator stops. It only makes sure the poisson is first sent to all its output channels, so that the poisson can spread
 * to the connected operators.
