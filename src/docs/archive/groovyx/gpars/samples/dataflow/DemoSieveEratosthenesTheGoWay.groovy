/**
 * Demonstrates a concurrent implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes using dataflow tasks mimicking closely the example
 * given in the Google's Go programming language.
 *
 * In principle, the algorithm consists of concurrently run chained filters,
 * each of which detects whether the current number can be divided by a single prime number.
 * (generate nums 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...) -&gt; (filter by mod 2) -&gt; (filter by mod 3) -&gt; (filter by mod 5) -&gt; (filter by mod 7) -&gt; (filter by mod 11) -&gt; (caution! Primes falling out here)
 * The chain is built (grows) on the fly, whenever a new prime is found
