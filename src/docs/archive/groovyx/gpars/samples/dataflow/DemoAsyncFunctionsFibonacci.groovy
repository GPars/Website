/**
 * Demonstrates the way to use asyncFun() to build composable asynchronous functions.
 * Inspired by Alex Miller's post (http://tech.puredanger.com/2011/01/19/lamina-channels-and-async-tasks/)
 * and the experiments at https://github.com/ztellman/lamina/wiki/Asynchronous-functions
 *
 * The asyncFun() function allows the user to create an asynchronous variant of a function.
 * Such asynchronous functions accept asynchronous, potentially uncompleted, calculations as parameters (represented by DataflowVariables),
 * perform their own calculation asynchronously using the wrapping thread pool
 * and without blocking the caller they return a DataflowVariable representing a handle to the result of the ongoing asynchronous calculation.
