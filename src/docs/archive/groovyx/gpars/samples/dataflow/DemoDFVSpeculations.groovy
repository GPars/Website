/**
 * Demonstrates speculations - an ability to run in parallel several calculations of the same value with varying time demands,
 * harvesting the first obtained result and cancelling the slower calculations.
 *
 * In the sample we're willing to check whether there's an article on 'groovy' on DZone and we're using 4 urls, which resolve to the same page being downloaded.
 * Using the speculate approach we increased our chances to get the result even if some of the urls do not work or work considerably slower than others.
 *
 * This demo uses a DataflowVariable to get the first result. We're silently leveraging the ability of DataflowVariable
 * to accept re-binding to the same value.
