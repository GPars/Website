/**
 * Demonstrates the way to use asyncFun() to build composable asynchronous functions.
 * The asyncFun() function allows the user to create an asynchronous variant of a function.
 * Such asynchronous functions accept asynchronous, potentially uncompleted, calculations as parameters (represented by DataflowVariables),
 * perform their own calculation asynchronously using the wrapping thread pool
 * and without blocking the caller they return a DataflowVariable representing a handle to the result of the ongoing asynchronous calculation.
 *
 * This particular example demonstrates the ability of asynchronous functions to compose result promises.
 * If an asynchronous function (e.f. the 'distance' function in the example) in its body calls another asynchronous function
 * (e.g. 'plus') and returns the the promise of the invoked function, the inner function's (plus) result promise will compose with the outer function's (distance)
 * result promise. The inner function (plus) will now bind its result to the outer function's (distance) promise, once the inner function (plus) finishes its calculation.
 *
 * This ability of promises to compose allows functions to cease their calculation without blocking a thread not only when waiting for parameters,
 * but also whenever they call another asynchronous function anywhere in their body.
