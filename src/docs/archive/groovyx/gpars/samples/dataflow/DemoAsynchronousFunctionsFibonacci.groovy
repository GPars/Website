/**
 * Demonstrates the way to use DataflowVariables and tasks to create and combine composable asynchronous functions.
 * Inspired by Alex Miller's post (http://tech.puredanger.com/2011/01/19/lamina-channels-and-async-tasks/)
 * and the experiments at https://github.com/ztellman/lamina/wiki/Asynchronous-functions
 *
 * The asyncFun() mechanism is then a generalization of the principle shown here.
