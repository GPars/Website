/**
 * Demonstrates use of lazyTasks to lazily and asynchronously load mutually dependent components into memory.
 * The components (modules) will be loaded in the order of their dependencies and concurrently, if possible.
 * Each module will only be loaded once, irrespective of the number of modules that depend on it.
 * Thanks to laziness only the modules that are transitively needed will be loaded.
 * Our example uses a simple "diamond" dependency scheme: <br/>
 * D depends on B and C <br/>
 * C depends on A <br/>
 * B depends on A <br/>
 * When loading D, A will get loaded first. B and C will be loaded concurrently once A has been loaded. D will start loading
 * once both B and C have been loaded.
