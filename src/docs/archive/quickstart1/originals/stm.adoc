= STM (Software Transactional Memory)

== Concepts

=== Stm

Software Transactional Memory (STM) gives developers transactional semantics for accessing in-memory
data. When multiple threads share data in memory, by marking blocks of code as transactional (atomic) the
developer delegates the responsibility for data consistency to the Stm engine.  GPars leverages the
https://github.com/pveentjer/Multiverse[Multiverse STM engine].

=== Atomic closures

GPars allows developers to structure their concurrent code into atomic blocks (closures), which are then
performed as single units, preserving the transactional ACI (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation)
attributes.

== Usage

=== Running a piece of code atomically

----
import groovyx.gpars.stm.GParsStm
import org.multiverse.api.references.TxnInteger

import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.newTxnInteger

public class Account {
    private final TxnInteger amount = newTxnInteger(0);

    public void transfer(final int a) {
        GParsStm.atomic {
            amount.increment(a);
        }
    }

    public int getCurrentAmount() {
        GParsStm.atomicWithInt {
            amount.get();
        }
    }
}
----

=== Customizing the transactional properties

----
import groovyx.gpars.stm.GParsStm
import org.multiverse.api.AtomicBlock
import org.multiverse.api.PropagationLevel

final TxnExecutor block = GParsStm.createTxnExecutor(maxRetries: 3000, familyName: 'Custom', PropagationLevel: PropagationLevel.Requires, interruptible: false)
assert GParsStm.atomicWithBoolean(block) {
    true
}
