= Thread Pool

== Concepts

=== ThreadPool

On multi-core systems you can benefit from having some tasks run asynchronously in the background, and so
off-load your main thread of execution.  The _ThreadPool_ class allows you to easily start tasks in the
background to be performed asynchronously and collect the results later.

== Usage

=== Use of ThreadPool - the Java Executors' based concurrent collection processor

Closures enhancements

----
GParsExecutorsPool.withPool() {
    Closure longLastingCalculation = {calculate()}
    // Create a new closure, which starts the original closure on a thread pool.
    Closure fastCalculation = longLastingCalculation.async()
    // Returns almost immediately.
    Future result=fastCalculation()
    // Do stuff while calculation performs...
    println result.get()
}
----

----
GParsExecutorsPool.withPool() {
    /**
     * The callAsync() method is an asynchronous variant of the default call() method
     * to invoke a closure. It will return a Future for the result value.
     */
    assert 6 == {it * 2}.call(3).get()
    assert 6 == {it * 2}.callAsync(3).get()
}

=== Executor service enhancements

----
GParsExecutorsPool.withPool {ExecutorService executorService ->
    executorService << {println 'Inside parallel task'}
}
----

=== Asynchronous function processing

----
GParsExecutorsPool.withPool {
    // Waits for results.
    assert [10, 20] == AsyncInvokerUtil.doInParallel({calculateA()}, {calculateB()})
    // Returns a Future and doesn't wait for results to be calculated.
    assert [10, 20] == AsyncInvokerUtil.executeAsync({calculateA()}, {calculateB()})*.get()
}
