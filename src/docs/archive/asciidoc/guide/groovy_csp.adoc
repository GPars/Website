
= Groovy CSP

The CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) abstraction builds on independent composable processes, which
exchange messages in a synchronous manner.  GPars leverages http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/ofa/jcsp/[the
JCSP library] developed at the University of Kent, UK.

Jon Kerridge, the author of the CSP implementation in GPars, provides exhaustive examples on of GroovyCSP use at
http://www.soc.napier.ac.uk/~cs10/#_Toc271192596

****
The GroovyCSP implementation leverages JCSP, a Java-based CSP library, which is licensed under LGPL. There
are some differences between the Apache 2 license, which GPars uses, and LGPL. Please make sure your
application conforms to the LGPL rules before enabling the use of JCSP in your code.
****

If the LGPL license is not adequate for your use, you might consider checking out the Dataflow Concurrency
chapter of this User Guide to learn about _tasks_ , _selectors_ and _operators_ , which may help you resolve
concurrency issues in ways similar to the CSP approach.  In fact the dataflow and CSP concepts, as
implemented in GPars, stand very close to each other.

****
By default, without actively adding an explicit dependency on JCSP in your build file or downloading and
including the JCSP jar file in your project, the standard commercial-software-friendly Apache 2 License
terms apply to your project. GPars directly only depends on software licensed under licenses compatible with
the Apache 2 License.

== The CSP model principles

In essence, the CSP model builds on independent concurrent processes, which mutually communicate through
channels using synchronous (i.e. rendezvous) message passing. Unlike actors or dataflow operators, which
revolve around the event-processing pattern, CSP processes place focus the their activities (aka sequences
of steps) and use communication to stay mutually in sync along the way.

Since the addressing is indirect through channels, the processes do not need to know about one another. They
typically consist of a set of input and output channels and a body. Once a CSP process is started, it
obtains a thread from a thread pool and starts processing its body, pausing only when reading from a channel
or writing into a channel. Some implementations (e.g. GoLang) can also detach the thread from the CSP
process when blocked on a channel.

CSP programs are deterministic. The same data on the program's input will always generate the same output,
irrespective of the actual thread-scheduling scheme used. This helps a lot when debugging CSP programs as
well as analyzing deadlocks.

Determinism combined with indirect addressing result in a great level of composability of CSP processes. You
can combine small CSP processes into bigger ones just by connecting their input and output channels and then
wrapping them by another, bigger containing process.

The CSP model introduces non-determinism using _Alternatives_. A process can attempt to read a value from
multiple channels at the same time through a construct called _Alternative_ or _Select_. The first value
that becomes available in any of the channels involved in the _Select_ will be read and consumed by the
process. Since the order of messages received through a _Select_ depends on unpredictable conditions during
program run-time, the value that will get read is non-deterministic.

== CSP with GPars dataflow

GPars provides all the necessary building blocks to create CSP processes.

* *CSP Processes* can be modelled through GPars tasks using a _Closure_, a _Runnable_ or a _Callable_ to
   hold the actual implementation of the process
* *CSP Channels* should be modelled with _SyncDataflowQueue_ and _SyncDataflowBroadcast_ classes
* *CSP Alternative* is provided through the _Select_ class with its _select_ and _ prioritySelect_ methods

=== Processes

To start a process simply use the _task_ factory method.

----
import groovyx.gpars.group.DefaultPGroup
import groovyx.gpars.scheduler.ResizeablePool

group = new DefaultPGroup(new ResizeablePool(true))

def t = group.task {
    println "I am a process"
}

t.join()
----

****
Since each process consumes a thread for its lifetime, it is advisable to use resizeable thread pools as in the example above.
****

A process can also be created from a Runnable or Callable object:

----
import groovyx.gpars.group.DefaultPGroup
import groovyx.gpars.scheduler.ResizeablePool

group = new DefaultPGroup(new ResizeablePool(true))

class MyProcess implements Runnable {

    @Override
    void run() {
        println "I am a process"
    }
}
def t = group.task new MyProcess()

t.join()
----

Using Callable allows for values to be returned through the _get()_ method:

----
import groovyx.gpars.group.DefaultPGroup
import groovyx.gpars.scheduler.ResizeablePool

import java.util.concurrent.Callable

group = new DefaultPGroup(new ResizeablePool(true))

class MyProcess implements Callable<String> {

    @Override
    String call() {
        println "I am a process"
        return "CSP is great!"
    }
}
def t = group.task new MyProcess()

println t.get()
----

=== Channels

Processes typically need channels to communicate with the other processes as well as with the outside world:

----
import groovy.transform.TupleConstructor
import groovyx.gpars.dataflow.DataflowReadChannel
import groovyx.gpars.dataflow.DataflowWriteChannel
import groovyx.gpars.group.DefaultPGroup
import groovyx.gpars.scheduler.ResizeablePool

import java.util.concurrent.Callable
import groovyx.gpars.dataflow.SyncDataflowQueue

group = new DefaultPGroup(new ResizeablePool(true))

@TupleConstructor
class Greeter implements Callable<String> {
    DataflowReadChannel names
    DataflowWriteChannel greetings

    @Override
    String call() {
        while(!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
            String name = names.val
            greetings << "Hello " + name
        }
        return "CSP is great!"
    }
}

def a = new SyncDataflowQueue()
def b = new SyncDataflowQueue()

group.task new Greeter(a, b)

a << "Joe"
a << "Dave"
println b.val
println b.val
----

****
The CSP model uses synchronous messaging, however, in GPars you may consider using asynchronous channels as well as synchronous ones.
You can also combine these two types of channels within the same process.
****

=== Composition

Grouping processes is then just a matter of connecting them with channels:

----
group = new DefaultPGroup(new ResizeablePool(true))

@TupleConstructor
class Formatter implements Callable<String> {
    DataflowReadChannel rawNames
    DataflowWriteChannel formattedNames

    @Override
    String call() {
        while(!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
            String name = rawNames.val
            formattedNames << name.toUpperCase()
        }
    }
}

@TupleConstructor
class Greeter implements Callable<String> {
    DataflowReadChannel names
    DataflowWriteChannel greetings

    @Override
    String call() {
        while(!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
            String name = names.val
            greetings << "Hello " + name
        }
    }
}

def a = new SyncDataflowQueue()
def b = new SyncDataflowQueue()
def c = new SyncDataflowQueue()

group.task new Formatter(a, b)
group.task new Greeter(b, c)

a << "Joe"
a << "Dave"
println c.val
println c.val
----

=== Alternatives

To introduce non-determinist GPars offers the _Select_ class with its _select_ and _prioritySelect_ methods:

----
import groovy.transform.TupleConstructor
import groovyx.gpars.dataflow.SyncDataflowQueue
import groovyx.gpars.dataflow.DataflowReadChannel
import groovyx.gpars.dataflow.DataflowWriteChannel
import groovyx.gpars.dataflow.Select
import groovyx.gpars.group.DefaultPGroup
import groovyx.gpars.scheduler.ResizeablePool

import static groovyx.gpars.dataflow.Dataflow.select

group = new DefaultPGroup(new ResizeablePool(true))

@TupleConstructor
class Receptionist implements Runnable {
    DataflowReadChannel emails
    DataflowReadChannel phoneCalls
    DataflowReadChannel tweets
    DataflowWriteChannel forwardedMessages

    private final Select incomingRequests = select([phoneCalls, emails, tweets])  //prioritySelect() would give highest precedence to phone calls

    @Override
    void run() {
        while(!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
            String msg = incomingRequests.select()
            forwardedMessages << msg.toUpperCase()
        }
    }
}

def a = new SyncDataflowQueue()
def b = new SyncDataflowQueue()
def c = new SyncDataflowQueue()
def d = new SyncDataflowQueue()

group.task new Receptionist(a, b, c, d)

a << "my email"
b << "my phone call"
c << "my tweet"

//The values come in random order since the process uses a Select to read its input
3.times{
    println d.val.value
}
----

=== Components

CSP processes can be composed into larger entities. Suppose you already have a set of CSP processes (aka
Runnable/Callable classes), you can compose them into a larger process:

----
final class Prefix implements Callable {
    private final DataflowChannel inChannel
    private final DataflowChannel outChannel
    private final def prefix

    def Prefix(final inChannel, final outChannel, final prefix) {
        this.inChannel = inChannel;
        this.outChannel = outChannel;
        this.prefix = prefix
    }

    public def call() {
        outChannel << prefix
        while (true) {
            sleep 200
            outChannel << inChannel.val
        }
    }
}
----

----
final class Copy implements Callable {
    private final DataflowChannel inChannel
    private final DataflowChannel outChannel1
    private final DataflowChannel outChannel2

    def Copy(final inChannel, final outChannel1, final outChannel2) {
        this.inChannel = inChannel;
        this.outChannel1 = outChannel1;
        this.outChannel2 = outChannel2;
    }

    public def call() {
        final PGroup group = Dataflow.retrieveCurrentDFPGroup()
        while (true) {
            def i = inChannel.val
            group.task {
                outChannel1 << i
                outChannel2 << i
            }.join()
        }
    }
}
----

----
import groovyx.gpars.dataflow.DataflowChannel
import groovyx.gpars.dataflow.SyncDataflowQueue
import groovyx.gpars.group.DefaultPGroup

group = new DefaultPGroup(6)

def fib(DataflowChannel out) {
    group.task {
        def a = new SyncDataflowQueue()
        def b = new SyncDataflowQueue()
        def c = new SyncDataflowQueue()
        def d = new SyncDataflowQueue()
        [new Prefix(d, a, 0L), new Prefix(c, d, 1L), new Copy(a, b, out), new StatePairs(b, c)].each { group.task it}
    }
}

final SyncDataflowQueue ch = new SyncDataflowQueue()
group.task new Print('Fibonacci numbers', ch)
fib(ch)

sleep 10000
