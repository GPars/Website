 * Demonstrates how to use existing thread pool to build an instance of PGroup and then retrieve the pool back from the group.
 * The ability to reuse the same thread pool by instances of parallel groups may come in handy when building applications
 * combining multiple GPars concepts, e.g. dataflow tasks with parallel collections.
