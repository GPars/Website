/**
 * Demonstrates the ability to receive multiple messages and selectively reply to some of them.
 * Notice the ability to sent HashMaps as well as instances of the Offer class as messages.
 * A custom pooled actor group is used to group the actors with a single thread pool.
 * The actors, which have submitted their offers, terminate, if they don't hear back from the actor within a timeout.
 * The main threads joins all actors to wait for their termination, since we're using a non-daemon actor group.
