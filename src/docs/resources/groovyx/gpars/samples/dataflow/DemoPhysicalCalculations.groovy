Calculating distance required to stop a moving ball.
====================================================
The ball has a radius of ${radius.val} meters and is made of a material with ${density.val} kg/m3 density,
which means that the ball has a volume of ${volume.val} m3 and a mass of ${mass.val} kg.
The ball has been accelerating with ${acceleration.val} m/s2 from 0 for ${time.val} seconds and so reached a velocity of ${velocity.val} m/s.

Given our ability to push the ball backwards with a force of ${decelerationForce.val} N (Newton), we can cause a deceleration
of ${deceleration.val} m/s2 and so stop the ball at a distance of ${distance.val} m.

=======================================================================================================================
This example has been calculated asynchronously in multiple threads using GPars Dataflow concurrency in Groovy.
