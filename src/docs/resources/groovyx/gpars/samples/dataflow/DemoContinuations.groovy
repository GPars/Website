/**
 * In the example using the right shift operator in place of the whenBound method, you can see one task consuming
 * user input from the console, while the second thread uses the supplied values concurrently to calculate the tax rate,
 * which is then in turn displayed by the first console task.
 * Using the continuation style we never consume a thread while we wait for the user input and have nothing to compute at the moment.
