/**
 * Demonstrates the way to use asyncFun() to build composable asynchronous functions.
 * The asyncFun() function allows the user to create an asynchronous variant of a function.
 * Such asynchronous functions accept asynchronous, potentially uncompleted, calculations as parameters (represented by DataflowVariables),
 * perform their own calculation asynchronously using the wrapping thread pool
 * and without blocking the caller they return a DataflowVariable representing a handle to the result of the ongoing asynchronous calculation.
 *
 * Notice the pool may not exist when the asynchronous functions are being created. The functions can pick up a thread pool
 * each time they are invoked.
