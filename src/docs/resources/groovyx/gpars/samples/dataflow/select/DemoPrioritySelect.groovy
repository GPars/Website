/**
 * Shows a basic use of Priority Select, which monitors a set of input channels for values and makes these values
 * available on its output irrespective of their original input channel.
 * Note that dataflow variables and streams can be combined for Select.
 * Unlike plain select method call, the prioritySelect call gives precedence to input channels with lower index.
 * Available messages from high priority channels will be served before messages from lower-priority channels.
 * Messages received through a single input channel will have their mutual order preserved.
