/**
 * Demos another possible use of Groovy immutable support for the classical
 * account money transfer problem.
 * Account becomes immutable without knowing anything about synchronization.
 * However, since transferTo() returns two new Accounts, these references
 * must be assigned in one atomic action. This is what ListSafe cares for.
 * It also supports an atomic get-and-set operation for updating the
 * reference list safely.
 * Note that this puts the parallel transfer calls in a strict,
 * yet not foreseeable sequence. It effectively disables concurrent transfers.
 * This may still be valuable since it
 * reliefs the account from knowing about concurrency.
