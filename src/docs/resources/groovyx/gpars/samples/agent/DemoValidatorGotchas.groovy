/**
 * With Groovy being not very strict on data types and immutability, agent users should be aware of potential bumps on the road.
 * If the submitted code modifies the state directly, validators will not be able to un-do the change in case of a validation rule violation.
 * There are two possible solutions available:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Make sure you never change the supplied object representing current agent state</li>
 * <li>Use custom copy strategy on the agent to allow the agent to create copies of the internal state</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * In both cases you need to call _updateValue()_ to set and validate the new state properly.
 * The problem as well as both of the solutions are shown here.
