 * Shows two cooperating agents.
 * Although it would be tempting to use acc1 from within the function processed by a2, it would violate the encapsulation
 * rule of agents and could lead to any of the ugly shared mutable state issues.
 * It is important to ensure that agents do not leak their internal state to the other agents.
