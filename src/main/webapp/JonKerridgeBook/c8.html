<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Chapter 7</code> demonstrated, with two examples, one obvious and the other less so, that deadlocked systems can be constructed quite easily even if the thought given to the design would suggest otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A design pattern is required that ensures <strong>deadlock</strong> and also <strong>livelock</strong> freedom. <em>Brinch Hansen</em> formulated a design approach for operating systems in the 1970s based upon a client-server architecture.
It is a slightly updated version of that design approach that is presented here as the client-server design pattern. It is captured in two simple rules, together with a method for analysing a network.</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A client process that issues a request to a server process guarantees to accept any response from that server immediately. A <code>client â€“ server</code> interaction requires a client request upon the server but it is not necessary for there to be a communication from the server to the client process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A server process that accepts a request from a client process guarantees to return a response to the client process within finite time. In addition, a server process will never send a message to any of its clients without having first received a request from a client. A server process can behave as a client to another server process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deadlock and livelock will not occur in such a network of client and server processes, provided a labelling of the client and server ends of the interactions between processes, does not result in a completed circuit of clients and servers.</p>
